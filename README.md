Question: 
4. The Fibonacci sequence is the series of numbers 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, .... Formally, it can be expressed as: fib0 = 0 fib1 = 1   fibn = fibn−1 + fibn−2. Write a multithreaded program that generates the Fibonacci sequence. This program should work as follows: On the command line, the user will enter the number of  Fibonacci numbers that the program  is  to  generate.  The  program  will  then  create  a  separate  thread  that  will  generate  the Fibonacci  numbers,  placing  the  sequence  in  data  that  can  be  shared  by  the  threads  (an  array  is probably the most convenient data structure). When the thread finishes execution, the parent thread will output the sequence generated by the child thread. Because theparent thread cannot begin outputting the Fibonacci sequence until the child thread finishes, the parent thread will have to wait for the child thread to finish.

The solution is based upon the question listed above.

This program is written in C language.
